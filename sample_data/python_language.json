  "summary": "Pythonis ahigh-level,general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizescode readabilitywith the use ofsignificant indentation.[33]Python isdynamically type-checkedandgarbage-collected. It supports multipleprogramming paradigms, includingstructured(particularlyprocedural),object-orientedandfunctional programming. Guido van Rossumbegan working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to theABCprogramming language. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completelybackward-compatiblewith earlier versions. Beginning with Python 3.5,[34]capabilities and keywords for typing were added to the language, allowing optionalstatic typing.[35]As of 2026[update], the Python Software Foundation supports Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14, following the project's annual release cycle and five-year support policy. Python 3.15 is currently in the alpha development phase, and the stable release is expected to come out in October 2026.\"[36]Earlier versions in the 3.x series have reached end-of-life and no longer receive security updates. Python has gained widespread use in themachine learningcommunity.[37][38][39][40]It is widely taught as an introductory programming language.[41]Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten of the most popular programming languages in theTIOBE Programming Community Index, which ranks based on searches in 24 platforms.[42]",
