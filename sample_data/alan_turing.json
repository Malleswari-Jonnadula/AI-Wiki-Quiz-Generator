  "summary": "Alan Mathison Turing(/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an Englishmathematician,computer scientist,logician,cryptanalyst,philosopherandtheoretical biologist.[6]He was highly influential in the development oftheoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts ofalgorithmandcomputationwith theTuring machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purposecomputer.[7][8][9]Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science.[10] Born in London, Turing was raised insouthern England. He graduated fromKing's College, Cambridge, and in 1938, earned a doctorate degree fromPrinceton University. DuringWorld War II, Turing worked for theGovernment Code and Cypher SchoolatBletchley Park, Britain'scodebreakingcentre that producedUltraintelligence. He ledHut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Turing devised techniques for speeding the breaking of Germanciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polishbombamethod, anelectromechanicalmachine that could find settings for theEnigma machine. He played a crucial role in cracking intercepted messages that enabled theAlliesto defeat theAxis powersin theBattle of the Atlanticand other engagements.[11][12] After the war, Turing worked at theNational Physical Laboratory, where he designed theAutomatic Computing Engine, one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joinedMax Newman'sComputing Machine Laboratoryat theUniversity of Manchester, where he contributed to the development of earlyManchester computers[13]and became interested inmathematical biology. Turing wrote on the chemical basis ofmorphogenesis[14][1]and predictedoscillating chemical reactionssuch as theBelousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by theOfficial Secrets Act.[15]",
